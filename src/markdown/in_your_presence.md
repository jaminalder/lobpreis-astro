# In your presence, o God

In your presence, that's where I am strong  
in your presence, o Lord, my God  
in your presence, that's where I belong  
seeking your face, touching your grace  
in the cleft of the Rock, in your presence, o God

I want to go where the rivers cannot overflow me  
where my feet are on the Rock

I want to hide where the blazing fire cannot burn me  
in your presence, o God

I want to hide where the flood of evil cannot reach me  
where I'm covered by the blood

I want to be where the shames of darkness cannot touch me  
in your presence, o God

You are my firm foundation  
I trust in you all day long  
I am your child and your servant  
and you are my strength and my song

you are my song

In your presence, that's where I am strong  
in your presence, o Lord, my God  
in your presence, that's where I belong  
seeking your face, touching your grace  
in the cleft of the Rock, in your presence, o God  
seeking your face, touching your grace  
in the cleft of the Rock, in your presence, o God
