# Moving with the Lamb

For I'm moving with the Lamb,   
moving with the Lamb, I'm surrounded.

I´m strolling with the Lamb,  
strolling with the King of kings, 

stepping with the Lamb,  
stepping over my sins.

For I'm dressed in a holy robe of God, I'm surrounded,   
by the host of heaven's court and the King of kings,   
and I drink from the holy cup of God, I'm surrounded, 

I'm moving with the Lamb,   
I'm strolling with the Lamb,   
I´m stepping with the Lamb.
