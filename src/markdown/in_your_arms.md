# In your arms

You know all about me  
and everything I do,  
Lord, you know my thoughts from far away!  
  
Your strong right hand protects me,  
I can feel it on my shoulder and your Spirit is everywhere I go!  
  
You are all around, in front of me and behind!   
  
In your arms, Lord I am safe,   
Sourrounded by your holiness and grace,   
Your arms, Lord, are my hiding place,  
The place where I belong and where I'm strong,   
In your arms!   
  
You formed me, my Creator, in an amazing way,   
you could see me grow each passing day.   
Examine me and test me,  
Let my mind have understanding,  
lead me on the path of righteousness!   
  
You are all around, in front of me and behind!   
  
In your arms, Lord I am safe,   
Sourrounded by your holiness and grace,   
Your arms, Lord, are my hiding place,  
The place where I belong and where I'm strong,   
In your arms!   
  
And even the dark  
would be as bright as the day,  
If I wanted to find a place to escape,   
on the wings of the morning, over the seas,   
You would take hold of me, hold of me!
