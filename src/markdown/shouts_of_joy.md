# Shouts of joy

Shouts of joy and victory resound in the tents  
of the righteous of the Lord  
shouts of joy and victory resound in the tents  
of the righteous of the Lord

the Lord's right hand has done mighty things for us  
the Lord's right hand is lifted high  
the Lord's right hand has done mighty things for us  
the Lord's right hand reigns on high, the Lord's right hand reigns on high

sing for Joy in the Lord  
o ye righteous ones  

sing for him a new song  
let your heart rejoice in him  

o magnify the Lord with me  
let us exalt his name together   
o magnify the Lord with me  
let us exalt his name 

bless his holy (3x) bless his holy name with shouts of joy...

For the Lord has  
taken your punishment  
destroyed your enemies

King of Israel  
Lord of all is he  
in the midst of us  
He is mighty
